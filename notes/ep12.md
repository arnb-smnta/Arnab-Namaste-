#Redux
We will learn to build our own redux store and how we can manage state of our application and also data of our app.
Redux is not mandatory if you are bulding small application it is not mandatory.

Redux and React are different libraries not same .
Zustand is also a library like redux

Redux offers easier Debugger

We will build cart with redux

REDUX STORE
it s a big object with a lot of data in ir its kept in central global place

ANY component can acess{any component in project can write and read data} this redux store and it is a very big object

-Install @reduxjs/toolkit and react-redux
-Build our store
-connect our store to our app
-slice(cartslice)
-dispatch (action)
-selector

1.Build store
import{configureStore} from react-redux
import cartReducer from "cartSlice"
const appStore=configureStore({
reducer:{
cart:cartReducer// specific slice reducer
}
})
export default appStore

2.Slice

const cartSlice=creatSlice({
name:"cart"//name of the slice
initialState:{
items:[]
},
reducers:{
addItem:(state,action)=>{
state.items.push(action.payload)
},
removeItem:(state,action)=>{
state.items.pop();
},
clearCart:()=>{
state.items.length=0;
},
}
})

export const {addItem,removeItem,clearItem}=cartSlice.actions;//special redux syntax to export reducers

export default cartSlice.reducer;

3.dispatch(action)

import {Dispatch} from react-redux
const dispatch=useDispatch()

dispatch(addItem("item"))

additem is the reducer funtion over here

4.Selectors

const cartItems=useSelector((store)=>{
return store.cart.items
})

[store.slicename.itemlist]

Important

Why using selector only subscribe to the specific slice that you need because it will have huge performance loss

console.log(current(state))
