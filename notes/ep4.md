Inline styles in JSX ar in line js code style={}

To dynamically pass data in a component we use props
Props are just normal arguments to a function -Exactly like saying passing a argument in a function
We can pass any number of props in componenets

We can destructure it on the fly like destructuring of objects

Config driven UI-Websites are driven by configs(data) .Data is the config .

Whenever you are looping or maping in JSX componets always pass a uniquey key prop in the props for uniquefication
