How to set up your application to write test cases
1.React testing library

Jest -Standard to write test cases in the industry

# Setting up testing in our app

- Install react testing library
- Installed Jest
- Install babel dependencies (this are required when using with babel)
- Configure bebel.js
- configure parcel to disable babel transpilation for parcel docs -babel
- npm run test
- Jest configuration (npx jest --init) \_\_\_Read about jsdom
- Install jsdom library
  Note: Parcel already use babael behind the scenes so the babel.config.js we are trying ti use babel with our own configuration so babel.config.js will overwrite the parcels babel configuration for us to use with our own configuration, so we have to change some parcel configuration

- install @babel/preset-react= to make JSX work in test cases
- Include @babel/preset-react inside my babel config
- Include @testing-library/jest-dom(fot toBeInTheDocument)

# Test folder(**tests**)

any js files made under this folder will be considered test files

also test.js,test.ts,spec.ts,spec.js al file with this extension will be considered test files

- input box is called textbox

# it and test are one and the same thing

We can write it in place of test

# fireEvent.event to see events happening in a sole component in test cases
